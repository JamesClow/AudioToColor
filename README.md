# Color My Audio

Color My Audio is a windows application I developed in C# to visualize audio through an array of colors.

##About
The basis of this application is that music is merely a collection of waves. 
Thus, the application is able to composes an individual color sample by averaging the waves amplitude and dominate frequency over a given period of time and associating the two with luminance and saturation respectively.
Then the hue of each color is determined based on the overall tempo of the song.
Finally once the colors have been created they are converted from their HSL format to a RGB format so that they can be view on a screen.
